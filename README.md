## Telegram Bot with YOLOv5 and AWS Infrastructure Managed by Terraform
This project integrates a Telegram bot (Polybot) with the YOLOv5 AI model to provide object detection for user-uploaded images. Using Terraform, the infrastructure is automated, ensuring scalability, security, and efficient management across AWS services.

## Project Overview

_**1. Telegram Bot (Polybot):**_
  - Allows users to upload images through Telegram.
  - Responds with object detection results using the YOLOv5 model.

_**2. YOLOv5 AI Model:**_
  - Processes images and detects objects.
  - Results are stored in DynamoDB and returned to the user.
  
_**3. Containerized Architecture:**_
  - Both Polybot and YOLOv5 are Dockerized and hosted on DockerHub, simplifying deployment.

_**4. Terraform-Managed AWS Infrastructure:**_
  - Automates provisioning, deployment, and scaling across AWS services.
  - Ensures secure and reliable communication between components.

## Testing Phase

To ensure reliability and precision, the infrastructure was initially deployed manually. This allowed verification of each component's functionality and ensured seamless communication between the Telegram bot, YOLOv5 model, and AWS services.

Once validated, the environment was transitioned to Terraform, which simplifies the deployment process to a few minutes and optimizes cloud workflows.

This repository contains all the Terraform files used to provision the infrastructure, including a well-defined architecture and modular design. Five distinct Terraform modules were created, each specializing in a unique cloud task.

Below is a detailed explanation of these modules, starting with the first: the Internet environment.


## AWS Services Used

- VPC: Provides a secure network environment with public subnets for application hosting.
- EC2 Instances: Host Polybot and YOLOv5 applications.
- Auto Scaling: Dynamically scales YOLOv5 instances to meet workload demands.
- IAM: Grants necessary permissions to securely access AWS resources.
- Amazon Machine Image (AMI): Ensures consistent YOLOv5 instance creation.
- DynamoDB: Stores object detection results for efficient retrieval.
- S3: Stores uploaded images securely.
- SQS: Facilitates communication between Polybot and YOLOv5.
- Secrets Manager: Manages sensitive data, such as Telegram bot tokens.
- CloudWatch: Monitors the health and performance of resources.
- Route 53: Manages DNS and domain configurations for the ALB.

## CI/CD Automation
After validating that the entire infrastructure works seamlessly, a CI/CD process was implemented using GitHub Actions. This automation further streamlined infrastructure deployment and updates.

**CI Process**
1. _**Defining the GitHub Actions Environment:**_
   - Configured a GitHub Actions workflow to:
     - Specify the machine type used for deployment.
     - Set the Terraform version required for the automation.
     - Define AWS credentials for secure access to the AWS environment.
2. _**Variables and Planning:**_
   - Used external variables, such as:
     - AWS Region
     - Private keys
     - Other dynamic inputs
   - Ran ```terraform plan``` to validate configurations and ensure no errors.
3. _**Applying Infrastructure:**_
   - Executed ```terraform apply``` to provision the infrastructure from scratch.

**CD Process**
1. _**Dynamic Configuration with Ansible:**_
   - Ansible was installed on Polybot instances to manage variables and configurations automatically.
   - Created an ```inventory.ini``` file containing the IP addresses of Polybot machines for seamless setup.
2. _**Automated Deployment of Polybot Container:**_
   - Extracted necessary variables dynamically, such as:
     - AWS Region
     - DynamoDB table name
     - ALB URL
     - S3 bucket name
     - SQS queue name
   - Used an Ansible playbook to deploy the Polybot container across machines uniformly and efficiently.

**Outcome**  
This CI/CD pipeline enables:
 - Automated infrastructure deployment and updates with Terraform (CI).
 - Quick and consistent configuration and container deployment with Ansible (CD).
 - Scalable and error-free processes, reducing setup time significantly.
